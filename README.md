# lambda-typescript-skeleton

This skeleton contains a basic lambda function written in typescript with tests, linting and deployment configuration using SAM.

# why typescript?

Having programmed in JS for quite a few years totally over watching myself and others make the same trivial mistakes. Typescripts aproach to base the langauge on JS, then introduce a safety net of types, along with a raft other small enhancements is much appreciated. My aim is to encourage new delelopers to use Typescript and skip the relative nightmare that is JS, at least until they have the basics.
